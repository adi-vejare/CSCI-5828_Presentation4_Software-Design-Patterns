<b>MONITOR OBJECT</b>
<p>
This pattern ensures only one thread can access the protected data or code. It is also called Thread-safe Passive Object or Code Locking Pattern.
</p>
<b>IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS IN JAVA:</b>

-	Every object and class is associated with a monitor. 
-	To implement the mutual exclusion capability of monitors, a lock (mutex) is associated with each object and class.
-	If a thread owns a lock, then no other thread can obtain the lock until the thread owing the lock releases it. 
-	In java there are synchronized methods and statements which help us to define the monitor region (data which cannot be accessed by more than one thread).
-	Each object/class will be associated with a Monitor. So, each object will have its own critical section and is capable of monitoring the thread sequence.
-	Java also provides wait() and notify() to suspend a thread and wake threads up that are waiting on the object respectively.
-	These methods can be invoked within a synchronized statement/method.
