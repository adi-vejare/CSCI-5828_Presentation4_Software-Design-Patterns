####Algorithmic Strategy Design Pattern

Algorithmic Strategy Design Patterns or simply Strategy Design Patterns focus on developing a method or formula to solve the problem. A common set of steps are followed considering the formula as a guideline to solve future problems. The behavior is decided at runtime based on conditions prevaling at runtime.

To understand the concept exactly, look at the image above. The problem at hand is going to the airport. We need to choose one of the modes of transport to reach the airport. This decision is made at runtime based on cost, time taken to reach, availability, etc. Looking at this problem for a Strategy Design, we can say that the formula is take a mode on transport considering certain paramters but make the decision at runtime only.
