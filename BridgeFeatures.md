#Features
-	It involves “decoupling” the implementation class and the abstract class by creating a bridge-like configuration between them
-	It is used when the class and its roles change often
-	An interface is the bridge which makes the functionalitites of the concrete classes and implementation classes independent 
-	We can add functionalities while the abstract classes help in maintaining the uniqueness
- It can be used to map map orthogonal class hierarchies.
- It enables implementation sharing between multiple objects.
- Run-time binding of the implementation can be achieved.
-	However, there exist complexity and performance issues in this pattern
