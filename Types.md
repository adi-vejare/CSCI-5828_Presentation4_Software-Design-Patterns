####Types

<p>Some of the Types of Software Design Patterns are :</p>

1. [Algorithmic Strategy Pattern](https://github.com/hariniiyer/CSCI-5828_Presentation4_Software-Design-Patterns/blob/master/AlgorithmicStrat.md)
2. Computational Design Pattern
3. [Execution Pattern](https://github.com/hariniiyer/CSCI-5828_Presentation4_Software-Design-Patterns/blob/master/ExePattern.md)
4. [Implementation Strategy Pattern]
5. [Structural Design Pattern](https://github.com/hariniiyer/CSCI-5828_Presentation4_Software-Design-Patterns/tree/master)

- As the number of patterns available has grown it became a necessity to organize these patterns into groups that shared the same set of properties namely,
- Creational patterns  – They deal with the process of object creation,
- Behavioral patterns  – They deal with the communication among classes and objects,
- Structural patterns  – They deal with composition of classes or objects and 
- Concurrency patterns – They try to support synchronization.


We are going to present in detail the Algorithmic Strategy Pattern, Execution Pattern and the Structural Design Pattern.
