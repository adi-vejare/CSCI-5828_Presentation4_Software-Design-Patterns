- The subject here is an object which maintains a list of dependents called observers.
- If any change of state happens, it notifies all the dependents of its change of state automatically. 

<b>REMARKS:</b>

- This pattern can cause memory leaks because of using both explicit registration and deregistration 
in its basic implementation since the subject holds strong references to the observers. 

- This can be prevented by replacing the strong references by weak references to the observers.
