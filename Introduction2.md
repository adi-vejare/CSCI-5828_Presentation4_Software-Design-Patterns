####Software Developed Without a Design Pattern!

Can a software be developed without following a Design Pattern?

<b><i>	
> Quite a few Software Design Patterns are fairly obvious. You would have to know them all very well to be sure you aren't using them - probably well enough that you might as well use them! â€“ James McLeod 
</i></b>

Hence, it is advantageous to decide a design pattern as per the requirement and resource availability, then go ahead with the development process.

Some advantages of using software design patterns are as follows:

+ Helps in avoiding common programming errors
+ Provides a scope for future development, hence scaling something can be less messy
+ Creates effective communication among the team, hence everyone is on the same page
+ It is a very structured way of looking at software development process

> Proper use of design patterns in software development allows you to exploit previous experience with proven arrangements of objects, greatly increasing the efficiency of the coding process. Apply design patterns in your next project and reap the benefits.
