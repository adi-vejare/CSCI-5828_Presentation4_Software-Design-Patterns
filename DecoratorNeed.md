###Need for Decorator Pattern
- Sometimes, it is required to extend an object's functionality dynamically ie. at runtime.
- We may want to give the client the flexibility of deciding the features.
- This can be solved by the Decorator pattern where the original object is encapsulated inside an abstract wrapper interface.
Both the core and decorator objects inherit from this abstract interface.
