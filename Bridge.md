###Bridge Design Pattern
-	This <I>pattern "decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently"</I>
-	It can be interpreted as the class being the implementation and its roles constituting the abstraction
-	It involves “decoupling” the implementation class and the abstract class by creating a bridge-like configuration between them
-	It is used when the class and its roles change often
-	An interface is the bridge which makes the functionalitites of the concrete classes and implementation classes independent 
-	We can add functionalities while the abstract classes help in maintaining the uniqueness
-	However, there exist complexity and performance issues in this pattern
