-	The client calls a function with the proxy object.

- This proxy in creates a future so that a value if returned can be sent to the client.

- Proxy also creates a method request which is told about the future.

- This method request is then sent to a scheduler which then dispatches the requests to the servant when they become runnable.

- This method request is placed in an activation list by the scheduler. 

<br>

<b>Even if this pattern can solve many problems it is not always suitable because of the following reasons.</b>

- The request and execution both happens in separate threads.

- Scheduling and registration slows it down.

- It is more complicated than necessary.
