###Decorator design pattern
-	This pattern allows modification of an object dynamically
-	It is used when we need inheritance capabilities but additionally need to add functionality at runtime
-	The additional funcationalities are provided while keeping the class methods signature intact
-	It is more flexible than inheritance
-	It involves extending with new code rather than rewriting old ones
-	A decorator class which encapsulates the original class is created
-	It adds "decorations" or additional features to an element but does not change the basic structure
