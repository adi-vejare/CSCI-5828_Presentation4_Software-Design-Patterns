###The ACTIVE OBJECT design pattern:

-	It decouples method execution from method invocation and simplifies synchronized access to objects that reside in their own threads of control.
-	They are used mainly in distributed system where multi-threaded servers are required.

<b>CLASS DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION</b>

- There are many classes present in this pattern. 
- Some of the classes are <b>Proxy, Scheduler, Activation List, Servant, Future, and Method Request.</b>

<b>Functions of the class</b>

- Proxy – It provides an interface that allows clients to access methods of an object and a method request is created for every method invoked on the proxy.
- Scheduler – A scheduler receives the method requests and dispatches them on the servant when they can run.
- Activation List – It maintains the pending method requests.
- Future – The results of a method call on the proxy is returned with the help of this class.
