###Need for Bridge design patterns
- It is sometimes required for an abstraction to have different implementations
- Inheritance ties the implementation to the abstraction and makes independent modification, extension and reuse of 
 abstraction and implementation.
- This causes difficulties in exponentially growing inheritance hierarchies.
- Hence, Bridge pattern is used to decouple the abstraction from the implementation.
