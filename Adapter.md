###Adapter Design Pattern
-	This pattern is used to make two incompatible interfaces to work together ie. adapts one to the other.
-	For example, if we have a two pin plug and a three pin socket, we need an adapter to interface them or make them work together. Adapter design pattern works in the same way.
-	The following are the key terminologies in this pattern:
  + Target is the specific interface used by the client in consistency with its objects.
  + Adaptee is the existing interface that requires translation/adapting so that the client can interact with it.
  + Adapter adapts/translates the adaptee to the target interface ie. essentially translating a client request to the adaptee.
