<b>Benefits of this pattern:</b>
<pre>
1)	Simplifies the scheduling method execution.

2)	Simplifies the concurrency control implementation.

3)	Locking mechanism and implementation are closely coupled.

</pre>

<b>Drawbacks of this pattern:</b>

<pre>
Some of the concurrency related problems are

1)	Handling multiple requests simultaneously.

2)	Regulate and schedule access to objects.

3)	Modify state of objects.

</pre>

<br>
<p><b>This monitor pattern does not always simplify the problems. It creates new problems too! 
</b>For example,</p>
<pre>
1)	It may lead to deadlocks.

2)	It may lead to starvation 

3)	The inherited methods will not automatically get synchronized.
