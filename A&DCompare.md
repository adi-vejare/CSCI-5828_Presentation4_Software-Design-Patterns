###Comparision with Adapter pattern
- Adapter gives the subject a different interface. Decorator gives an enhanced one.
- Adapter changes the object's interface while Decorator enhances its responsibilities.
- Decorator supports recursive composition(combining objects using recursive types or references). 
This is not possible with pure Adapters.
